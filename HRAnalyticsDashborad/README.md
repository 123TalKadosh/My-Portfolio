## Project 3: HR Analytics Dashborad

**Description:** The HR Analytics Dashboard project in Tableau reflects my commitment to presenting HR data in a user-friendly and interactive manner.
Leveraging Tableau, I've created a dashboard that simplifies complex workforce metrics, allowing for easy exploration of employee demographics, performance
indicators, and engagement levels. The emphasis here is on clarity and accessibility rather than showcasing technical prowess. The interactive features aim to
provide a comfortable and straightforward experience for users to analyze and draw insights from HR data, supporting more informed decision-making in human
resources management.

**Skills demonstrated:**
Tableau Proficiency, Data Visualization, User Experience Design, Communication Skills, Decision Support.
