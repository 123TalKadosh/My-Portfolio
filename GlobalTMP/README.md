## Project 1: Exploring Climate Trends

**Description:** This project offers an immersive dive into global temperature trends using R, where I meticulously examine how temperatures evolve month by
month across continents. This data science endeavor goes beyond mere observations, as it delves into identifying intriguing seasonal patterns, revealing
nuanced variations in temperature changes. The analysis extends further to explore the impact of months on global temperature trends, uncovering fascinating
insights. Additionally, continent-specific data analysis showcases the diverse effects of climate change globally.

**Skills demonstrated:**
R Programming, Data Wrangling, Data Visualization, Statistical Modeling.
